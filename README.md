# MAD402 Case Study 1 - Evaluating the design, UI and UX of Craigslist.


## Introduction (between 1 - 2 paragraphs)

In this evaluation, I will assess its design, use cases, and user experience (UX/UI) to understand its strengths and areas for improvement.

## Evaluation of the use cases and potential target audience for Craigslist (between 1 - 2 paragraphs and/or bullet point lists)

Craigslist has 8 categories and more than a hundred subcategories, making it usable in a wide range of use cases, and making it relevant to almost everyone.

You can buy/sell individually or as business, find jobs/hire talents, seek housing/list properties, access services, and engage with local communities with Craigslist.

## Evaluation of the overall design (between 1 - 2 paragraphs and/or bullet point lists)

Craigslist has a minimalist design which reduces distractions, help users to quickly find information. For example, users can immediately locate listings by keyword search without being overwhelmed and distracted by excessive graphics or animations. Its mostly text-based design let users get results quickly even with not so powerful computers and internet speeds.

But Craigslist's design weakness is also obvious. Its visual appeal is seriously lacking in modern times. Contemperary users that are accustomed to visually engaging layout with improved typography and imagery may find its archaic text-based user interface cryptic and intimidating. This may scare some users off.

Its code may have some bugs. For example, when I search "computer desk", it gives 61 results in total, some of them have no image, but when I do the same search with "has image" option enabled, it also gives 61 results in total.
