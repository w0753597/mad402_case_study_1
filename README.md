# MAD402 Case Study 1 - Evaluating the design, UI and UX of Craigslist.


## Introduction (between 1 - 2 paragraphs)

In this evaluation, I will assess its design, use cases, and user experience (UX/UI) to understand its strengths and areas for improvement.

## Evaluation of the use cases and potential target audience for Craigslist (between 1 - 2 paragraphs and/or bullet point lists)

Craigslist has 8 categories and more than a hundred subcategories, making it usable in a wide range of use cases, and making it relevant to almost everyone.

You can buy/sell individually or as business, find jobs/hire talents, seek housing/list properties, access services, and engage with local communities with Craigslist.

## Evaluation of the overall design (between 1 - 2 paragraphs and/or bullet point lists)

Craigslist has a minimalist design which reduces distractions, help users to quickly find information. For example, users can immediately locate listings by keyword search without being overwhelmed and distracted by excessive graphics or animations. Its mostly text-based design let users get results quickly even with not so powerful computers and internet speeds.

But Craigslist's design weakness is also obvious. Its visual appeal is seriously lacking in modern times. Contemperary users that are accustomed to visually engaging layout with improved typography and imagery may find its archaic text-based user interface cryptic and intimidating. This may scare some users off.

Its code may have serious bugs. For example, whether it's browsing a category or searching a keywords, most of the time it returns 61 results, and there is no way to get more results.


## Evaluation of the UI/UX of the app (between 1 - 2 paragraphs and/or bullet point lists)

Its user interface focuses on functionality and ease of use. This approach makes the UI very straightforward, whether it is browsing categories, search items, or creating new postings. I personally like this kind of no-frills UI design because it makes my interaction with the site faster and more efficient.

But the lack of transaction safety features makes it impossible to do serious business on this platform. Users should exercise extreme caution when using the platform to avoid falling victim to scams. 

## Conclusion (between 1 - 2 paragraphs)

Summing up, Craigslist's design works well but could look better. It might also make people feel safer and more interested if they add some safety stuff. Still, lots of different people find Craigslist useful because it's simple and can be used for all kinds of things.
